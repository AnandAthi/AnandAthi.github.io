My name is Anand Athinarayanan. My day job is software engineer in Toronto. I like to craft clean software following SOLID principles. I also work on building full stack Enterpise scale systems mostly in the Insurance domain. 
My primary tech stack at work is Guidewire Insurance Suite, Gosu and Java but like most Enterprise software I'm comfortable with a wide variety of programming languages and full stack development using MEAN, MERN, JAM solution stacks, Spring Boot and other cloud native software development tools.  
Like most polyglot software developers, I learn and hone my skills by learning and practicing new technology and programming languages working on side projects outside of day job. 

Outside of work is where things start to get interesting about me :) 
I I'm also interested in Science, History, Language, Philosophy and Culture. I like reading on a variety of topics and my most recent is FIRE - Financial Independence and Retire Early.
