 {% include navigation.html %}

My name is Anand Athinarayanan. My day job is a Software Engineer in Toronto. I like to craft clean software following SOLID principles. I also work on building full stack Enterpise scale systems mostly in the Insurance domain. 
My primary tech stack at work is Guidewire Insurance Suite, Gosu and Java but like many Enterprise Software Engineers I'm comfortable with a wide variety of programming languages and full stack development using MEAN, MERN and JAM solution stacks, Spring Boot and other cloud native software development tools and technologies.  
Like most polyglot Software Engineers, I hone my skills by learning and practicing new technology and programming languages, working on side projects, all of which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AnandAthi/). 
Headover to my Linkedin [Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandathinarayanan/) to know more about my skills and experience. You can also find me on the [Java Ranch Saloon](https://coderanch.com/u/246266/Anand-Athinarayanan) sipping Root Beers !

Outside of work is where things start to get interesting about me :) 
I love Science, History, Astronomy, Language, Philosophy, Religion, Culture, Finance, Politics and Environment/Activism. I like reading up and listening to podcasts on these topics. You can find my bookshelf on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/49757611-anand-athinarayanan?shelf=%23ALL%23) to get a hint of what I'm currently reading/listening now. 

Who doesn't like Travelling ? While I haven't done much myself yet, I(we) am picking up speed. My personal travel list includes visiting as much as possible from UNESCO's world heritage [list](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/). I'm a travel plan Chakravarti(Sanskrit for Emperor) and love planning down to a tee. 

My recent fetish is with the FIRE(Financial Independence Retire Early) movement. I realized this is my calling and life's purpose, for real :)

I'm also active on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Anand-Athinarayanan-%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%A9%E0%AE%A8%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%86%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%A3%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D), mostly upvoting and commenting and sometimes on Reddit too. Other channels are [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/anand.athinarayanan/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elankavii) but I'm not super active in them. 

Finally, I'm an avid meditation practioner, specifically the mindfulness meditation. I enjoy listening to Sam Harris and his insanely awesome meditation app - [Waking up](https://www.wakingup.com/).
