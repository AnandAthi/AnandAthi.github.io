My name is Anand Athinarayanan. My day job is software engineer in Toronto. I like to craft clean software following SOLID principles. I also work on building full stack Enterpise scale systems mostly in the Insurance domain. 
My primary tech stack at work is Guidewire Insurance Suite, Gosu and Java but like most Enterprise software engineers I'm comfortable with a wide variety of programming languages and full stack development using MEAN, MERN, JAM solution stacks, Spring Boot and other cloud native software development tools.  
Like most polyglot software developers, I learn and hone my skills by learning and practicing new technology and programming languages working on side projects outside of day job. Headover to my Linkedin [Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anandathinarayanan/) to know more about my skills and experience. You can also find me on the Java Ranch Salon sipping Root Beers !

Outside of work is where things start to get interesting about me :) 
I love Science, History, Language, Philosophy, Religion, Culture, Finance, Politics and Environment. I like reading up and listening to podcasts on these topics. 
You can find my bookshelf on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/49757611-anand-athinarayanan?shelf=%23ALL%23) to get a hint of what I'm currently reading now. 

I'm also active on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Anand-Athinarayanan-%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%A9%E0%AE%A8%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%86%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%A3%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D), mostly upvoting and commenting and sometimes on Reddit too.
