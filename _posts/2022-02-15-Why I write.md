To be really honest, I'm trying to learn the Jekyll blogging engine and Github pages, so this blog is entirely run on that. However, writing is a creative pursuit that I wanted to do for a long time. Back when I was in college, I wrote a couple of posts for my friend's blog - on the topics of Meditation and Politics - You really need to meditate if you want your mental health to be immune from this polarized mud slinging and sometimes hateful world of modern politics. 

Ok, enough nostalgia, coming back to the present. I wanted to have an online presence outside of social media. I started writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/) but never published it. I started and am currently learning Front end and UI development, so why not combine it with something I like; so that's why I started to write. No big deal, really !
